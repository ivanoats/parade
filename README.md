Parade is an open source presentation software that consists of a Sinatra web
app that serves up markdown files in a presentation format. Parade can serve a
directory or be configured to run with a simple configuration file.

## Comparison Vs PowerPoint / Keynote

Parade is easily out-done by professional presentation software packages as
far as out-of-the-box style and design. However, there are benefits that
Parade has over presentational software:

### Highlights

* Markdown backed data

    > This ultimately makes it easier to manage diffs when making changes,
    using the content in other documents, and quickly re-using portions of a
    presentation.

* Syntax Highlighting

    > Using GitHub flavored markdown, code fences will automatically be
    syntax highlighted, making it incredibly easy to integrate code samples.

* Code Execution

    > Slides are able to provide execution and show results for JavaScript
    and Coffeescript live within the browser. This allows for live
    demonstrations of code.

* Web

    >Slide presentations are basically websites -- they run in your browser from your desktop. This allows for a wide range of possibilities for customization and expandability.

* Basic Templating and Color Schemes

    > Several templates and color scheme options have been provided to help you get started. While Parade does not currently provide anything near the variety of many other presentation packages, it is well-suited for basic presentations.

* Design Flexibility (pros and cons)

    > Unless you're skilled in CSS/Animations, you will likely have a harder
    time creating presentations with as much polish as other programs provide. However, this approach also makes Parade incredibly flexible if you do understand CSS/Animations.


### Works In Progress

* Resizing

    > Currently, the presentation system can change gradual sizes, but does not
    have true full screen mode.

# Installation and Usage

```bash
$ gem install parade
```

## Starting the Slide Show

```bash
$ parade
```

By default, running parade starts a presentation from the current working
directory. It finds all markdown files, `**/*.md`, within the directory
and creates a presentation out of them.

>  By default parade will split slides along lines that start with a single `#`


## Slide Show Commands

You can manage the presentation with the following keys:

> ### *space* or *cursor right* or *cursor down*
>
> Advance to the next slide or advance the next incremental bullet point
or show the end result of the code execution.
>
> ### *shift-space* or *cursor left* or *cursor up*
>
> Move to the previous slide
>
> ### *h* or *?*
>
> Toggle help
>
> ### *f*
>
> Toggle footer (which shows slide count of total slides, percentage)
>
> ### *c* or *t*
>
> Toggle the display of the Table of Contents
>
> ### Visit "http://localhost:9090/print"
>
> Visiting this URL will generate a single page presentation that is printable
>

### Serving a specific directory

```bash
$ parade [directory]
```

This will start a presentation from the specified directory, finding all
markdown files contained within the directories or sub-directories.

### Serving specific files

To include certain files, specify an order, or duplicate slides, you will need to
define a `parade` file. Within that file, you may define specific files,
specific folders, and the order of the presentation.

```ruby
title "My Presentation"
slides "intro.md"
section "directory_name"
```

> **slides** and **section** are exactly the same. However, you may choose to
  use one over the other depending on if you are mentioning a specific file of
  slides or a directory which could contain another `parade` or be considered
  a section.

You can also define sub-sections with a title and slides or additional sections.

```ruby

title "My Presentation"

section "Introduction" do
  slides "intro.md"
end

section "Code Samples" do
  slides "ruby"
  slides "javascript"
  section "coffeescript"
end
```

# Slide Format

## Slide Separators

### Separator: **#**

Slides are simply markdown format. Slides will be separated along
the `#`elements within your document.

### Separator: !SLIDE

Relying on the `#` as a separator is not always ideal. Alternatively, you can
use the `!SLIDE` separator. This also provides you with the ability to define
additional metadata with your slides and presentation.

```markdown
!SLIDE

# My Presentation

!SLIDE bullets incremental transition=fade

# Bullet Points

* first point
* second point
* third point
```

> Using this separator will immediately override `#`, so you will have to
  insert `!SLIDE` separators in all places you would like cut your slides.

## Notes

You can define special notes that are shown in presenter mode.

> Presenter mode has been removed until it can be rebuilt

Add a line that starts with .notes:

```markdown
## Important Slide

* First Thing
* Second Things

.notes The reason that the second thing came about is because things changed.
```

> In this example, the HTML output will contain a `<p class='notes'>`
Toggle presenter notes with the `n` key while in the presentation.

> Presenter mode has been removed until it can be rebuilt

### Metadata

#### HTML IDs

```markdown
!SLIDE #slide-id-1
```

> In this example the id of the slide div would be set to `#slide-id-1`

You can define an ID that will be added to the slide's `div`. This id will be
set to any value prefaced with the `#` character.

#### Transitions

```markdown
!SLIDE transition=fade
```

> In this example, the slide will __fade__ when it is viewed. This will set
  `data-transition='fade'` on the slides's `div`.

You can define transitions from the available body of transitions.

The transitions are provided by jQuery Cycle plugin. See http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/browser.html to view the effects and http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/adv2.html for how to add custom effects.

##### Available Transitions

* none (this is the default)
* blindX, blindY, blindZ
* cover
* curtainX, curtainY
* fade
* fadeZoom
* growX, growY
* scrollUp, scrollDown, scrollLeft, scrollRight
* scrollHorz, scrollVert
* shuffle
* slideX, slideY
* toss
* turnUp, turnDown, turnLeft, turnRight
* uncover
* wipe
* zoom

#### CSS Classes

```markdown
!SLIDE bullets incremental my-custom-css-class
```
> In this example, this will add custom css classes to the slide's `div` will
  display the following classes:
  `class='content bullets incremental my-custom-css-class'`. _Note:_ the content
  class is added by the default slide template.

All remaining single terms are added as css classes to the slide's `div`.

##### Defined Classes

Parade defines a number of special CSS classes:

> ### title
> places the content closer to the center of the page
>
> ### center
> centers images on a slide
>
> ### title-and-content
> places the title at the top and the content is left-aligned below it.
>
> ### section-header
> similar to a `title` class except it is a litle further down the page.
>
> ### bullets
> sizes and separates bullets properly (fits up to 5, generally)
>
> ### columns / comparison
>
> creates columns for every `##` markdown element in your slides (up to 4)
>
> ### smbullets
> sizes and separates more bullets (smaller, closer together)
>
> ### command
> monospaces h1 title slides
>
> ### commandline
> for pasted commandline sections (needs leading '$' for commands, then
> output on subsequent lines)
>
> ### incremental
> can be used with 'bullets' and 'commandline' styles, will incrementally
>  update elements on arrow key rather than switch slides
>
> ### text-size-(percentage)
> make all slide text size from 70% up to 150%, by percent increments of
> ten. E.G.: text-size-150, text-size-120, text-size-90, text-size-70.
>
> ### execute
> on Javascript and Coffeescript highlighted code slides, you can
> click on the code to execute it and display the results on the slide
>
> ### blank
> a slide without content is removed unless you specify that the slide is
> blank.


# Presentation Customization

## Themes

Parade comes with a set of themes which can be enabled in your **parade** file:

```ruby

title "My Presentation"

theme "hack"

section "Introduction" do
  slides "intro.md"
end

```

### Available Themes

* archetect
* hack
* hayfield
* merlot
* minimal
* slate

### Customized Footer

The presentation has the following default footer:

```html
<div id="footer">
  <span id="slideInfo"></span>
  <span id="debugInfo"></span>
  <span id="notesInfo"></span>
</div>
```

You can override the default footer of the presentation by specifying a file path to a customized footer.

```ruby
title "My Presentation"

footer "custom_footer.erb"

section "Introduction" do
  slides "intro.md"
end
```

This example will load a file named `customer_footer.erb` within your presentation directory.

## Loading Custom CSS and JavaScript

By default Parade will load most CSS and JavaScript it finds within the the
directory which parade was launched, the current working directory.

You may however also specify a single resource folder or multiple resource folders
which parade will load instead of the current working directory.

```ruby

title "My Presentation"

theme "hack"
resources "scripts"
resources "stylesheets"

section "Introduction" do
  slides "intro.md"
end

```

The following will look for a folder named *scripts* and a folder named
*stylesheets* relative to the current working directory and load all
the CSS and JavaScript files found within those directories.


## Custom JavaScript

To insert custom JavaScript into your presentation you can either place it into
a file (with extension .js) into the root directory of your presentation or you
can embed a *script* element directly into your slides. This JavaScript will
be executed—as usually—as soon as it is loaded.

If you want to trigger some JavaScript as soon as a certain page is shown or
when you switch to the next or previous slide, you can bind a callback to a
custom event:

### Appearance

* parade:willAppear

> triggered before the slide is presented

* parade:didAppear

> triggered after the slide is presented

* parade:show

### Disappearance

> triggered after the slide is presented

* parade:willDisappear

> triggered before the slide disappears

* parade:didDisappear

> triggered after the slide disppeared

### Navigation

* parade:next

> triggered when an attempt to move to the next slide or incremental bullet point

* parade:prev

> triggered when an attempt to move back a slide or incremental bullet point


These events are triggered on the "div.content" child of the slide, so you must
add a custom and unique class to your SLIDE to identify it:

```markdown
!SLIDE custom_and_unique_class
# 1st Example h1
<script>
// bind to custom event
$(".custom_and_unique_class").live("parade:show", function (event) {
  // animate the h1
  var h1 = $(event.target).find("h1");
  h1.delay(500)
    .slideUp(300, function () { $(this).css({textDecoration: "line-through"}); })
    .slideDown(300);

    return false;
});
</script>
```

This will bind an event handler for *parade:show* to your slide. The
h1-element will be animated, as soon as this event is triggered on that slide.

If you bind an event handler to the custom events *parade:next* or
*parade:prev*, you can prevent the default action (that is switching to the
appropriate slide) by returning *false*:

```markdown
!SLIDE prevent_default
# 2nd Example h1
<script>
$(".prevent_default").live("parade:next", function (event) {
  var h1 = $(event.target).find("h1");
  if (h1.css("text-decoration") === "none") {
    h1.css({textDecoration: "line-through"})
    return false;
  }
});
</script>
```

This will bind an event handler for *parade:next* to your slide. When you press
the right arrow key the first time, the h1-element will be decorated. When you
press the right arrow key another time, you will switch to the next slide.

The same applies to the *parade:prev* event, of course.

## Custom Stylesheets

To insert custom Stylesheets into your presentation you can either place it into
a file (with extension .css) into the root directory of your presentation or
you can embed a *link* element directly into your slides. This stylesheet will
be applied as soon as it is loaded.

The content generated by the slide is wrapped with a *div* with the class .+content+ like this.

```html
<div class="content">
<h1>jQuery &amp; Sinatra</h1>
<h2>A Classy Combination</h2>
</div>
```

This makes the .*content* tag a perfect place to add additional styling if that
is your preference. An example of adding some styling is here.

```css
.content {
  color: black;
  font-family: helvetica, arial;
}
h1, h2 {
  color: rgb(79, 180, 226);
  font-family: Georgia;
}
.content::after {
  position: absolute;
  right: 120px;
  bottom: 120px;
  content: url(jay_small.png);
}
```

Note that the example above uses CSS3 styling with ::*after* and the *content*
-attribute to add an image to the slides.


# Command Line Interface

```bash
